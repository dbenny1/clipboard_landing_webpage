## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

After this task, I intend to study CSS Grid and Flexbox indepth. I discovered I have a lot more to learn and get familiar with.
Furthermore, I intend to learn TailwindCSS and ReactJS.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/) - This helped me for CSS grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
